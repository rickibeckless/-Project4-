# Web Development Project 4 - *Cat Explorer*

Submitted by: **Ricki Beckless**

This web app: **The Cat Explorer allows users to randomly generate cats from TheCatAPI with its image, name, and other information such as the description. For filtering, the user has the option to "ban" a breed which prevents the banned breed from appearing again during the random generating.**

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **Clicking a button creates a new API fetch request and displays at least three attributes from the returned JSON data**
- [X] **Only one item/API call is viewable at a time**
- [X] **API calls appear random to the user**
- [X] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
